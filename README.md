I think that  the reason of the CPU consumption is because the program run of asynchronous way this cause that the progam have a elevete CPU execution.
The class  responsable of that consumption in the consumer because use all resources and  makes the program slow.

When i change the progam for resolve the problems of the comsumer and producer the CPU consumtion change radicaly
